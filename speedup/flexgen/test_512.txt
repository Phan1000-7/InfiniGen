Deep within a perpetually sunless chasm, a colossal geode split open millennia ago by an unknown cataclysm, lies the Obsidian City of Chronos. Its structures are not built but seemingly extruded from the chasm's volcanic glass walls, forming impossibly sharp, gleaming black towers and labyrinthine, shadowed alleyways. No natural light penetrates here; the city is illuminated by a complex network of bioluminescent fungi cultivated in crystalline veins running through the obsidian, casting an eerie, pulsating blue-green glow. The air is thick with the scent of ozone, cool metallic dust, and a faint, rhythmic ticking that seems to emanate from the very stones.
The city's architecture is a marvel of alien geometry, all acute angles and soaring, needle-like spires that defy gravity. Intricate, clockwork-like mechanisms are embedded within many structures â€“ gears of polished obsidian, springs of an unknown, resilient crystal, and pistons that hiss with escaping geothermal steam. These mechanisms, though ancient, still turn with an unnerving precision, their purpose long forgotten by most, yet integral to the city's continued, fragile existence. Whispers persist of a central chamber, the "Heartroom," where the Prime Mechanism dictates the city's rhythm and, some say, its fate.
